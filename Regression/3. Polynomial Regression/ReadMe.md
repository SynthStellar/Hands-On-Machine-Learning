# Polynomial Regression

This folder contains an implementation of **Polynomial Regression** using Python and Scikit-Learn.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **Polynomial Regression** model to predict salaries based on position level. The dataset used is `Position_Salaries.csv`, which consists of the following columns:
1. **Position** (Job title, categorical variable)
2. **Level** (Numerical representation of position seniority)
3. **Salary** (Dependent Variable - Target)

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn  

## ðŸ”§ Steps Implemented
1. **Importing the required libraries**
2. **Loading the dataset (`Position_Salaries.csv`)** using Pandas  
3. **Training a Linear Regression model** on the dataset  
4. **Training a Polynomial Regression model** with a degree of 4  
5. **Visualizing results** for both models  
6. **Making predictions** using both models  

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`).
2. Open `polynomial_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or [Google Colab](your-colab-link).
3. Run the notebook step by step to train and evaluate the model.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset (`Position_Salaries.csv`) contains **10 observations**, representing different job positions and their corresponding salaries, to analyze salary trends with polynomial regression.
