# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

This folder contains an implementation of **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** using Python and Scikit-Learn.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **K-NN algorithm** is used for classification, predicting whether a person will purchase a product based on age and estimated salary. The dataset used is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`, which contains:  
1. **Age**  
2. **Estimated Salary**  
3. **Purchased** (Target variable: 1 if purchased, 0 if not)

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn  

## ðŸ”§ Steps Implemented
1. **Importing Libraries**  
2. **Loading the dataset (`Social_Network_Ads.csv`)**  
3. **Splitting the dataset** into training and test sets  
4. **Feature Scaling** using StandardScaler  
5. **Training the K-NN classifier**  
6. **Making Predictions** for a new result and the test set  
7. **Evaluating the model** using the confusion matrix and accuracy score  
8. **Visualizing Decision Boundaries** for training and test sets  

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:  
2. Open `knn_classifier.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.  
3. Run the notebook step by step to train and evaluate the model.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset (`Social_Network_Ads.csv`) consists of user age, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a product (1 or 0).
