# Logistic Regression

This folder contains an implementation of **Logistic Regression** using Python and Scikit-Learn.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a person will purchase a product based on age and estimated salary. The dataset used is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`, which includes:
1. **Age**  
2. **Estimated Salary**  
3. **Purchased** (Target variable: 1 if purchased, 0 if not)

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn  

## ðŸ”§ Steps Implemented
1. **Importing the required libraries**  
2. **Loading the dataset (`Social_Network_Ads.csv`)** using Pandas  
3. **Splitting the dataset** into training and test sets  
4. **Feature Scaling**  
5. **Training the Logistic Regression model**  
6. **Making Predictions** for a new result and the test set  
7. **Evaluating the model** using the confusion matrix and accuracy score  
8. **Visualizing the results** for both training and test sets  

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`).
2. Open `logistic_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or [Google Colab](your-colab-link).
3. Run the notebook step by step to train and evaluate the model.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset (`Social_Network_Ads.csv`) contains data about users' age, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a product (target variable).
