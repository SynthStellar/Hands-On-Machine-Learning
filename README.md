## Association Rule Learning

This section covers techniques for discovering interesting relations between variables in large datasets. It includes algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth.

## Classification

Classification techniques are used to predict the category of a given dataset. This folder includes algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes.

## Clustering

Clustering involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Techniques include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. This section covers techniques for cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis, including normalization, handling missing values, and feature extraction.

## Deep Learning/Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Deep Learning involves neural networks with multiple layers. This folder includes resources on building and training neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the number of random variables under consideration. This section includes methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

## Model Selection & Boosting

Model selection involves choosing the best model for a given problem, while boosting techniques improve model performance. This folder includes resources on cross-validation, grid search, and algorithms like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP involves the interaction between computers and human language. This section covers techniques for text processing, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.

## Regression

Regression techniques are used to predict continuous values. This folder includes algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning involves training algorithms to make a sequence of decisions. This section covers techniques like Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
